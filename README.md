## The WeatherApp Java program is a simple console-based application that retrieves real-time weather data for a specified city using the OpenWeatherMap API. It constructs a URL with the city name and API key, sends an HTTP GET request using Java's HttpURLConnection, and reads the JSON response through a BufferedReader. The response is parsed using the org.json library to extract relevant information like temperature, humidity, and weather description, which are then printed to the console. The program demonstrates basic API integration, JSON parsing, and error handling in Java. Initially, it included incorrect and unnecessary imports, such as a conflicting static import for URL from Spring Boot and an unused DemoApplication import, both of which were removed to avoid compilation issues and streamline the code. Overall, it serves as a practical example of how to connect to external APIs in Java and process the returned data efficiently.
